This is normally found at the start of bash files.: `#/bin/bash`. The 'shebang': `#!` Must be followed with the path the the interpreter. It is a convention in Linux shells. PowerShell seems to figure it out by the extension though. Then you can just execute the script by just writing the file path, rather than bash path

To assign a value to a variable, the variable name is followed by the assignment operator (=) and the value. For example, `VARIABLE=value.` Cannot use spaces in variable assignment. Must use `local VARIABLE=value.` before any variable assignment to enforce local variables.

To access the value stored in a variable, the variable name is preceded by a dollar sign ($). For example, `echo $VARIABLE`

To use the value of a variable in a string, the variable name is enclosed by curly braces {} and preceded by a dollar sign. For example, echo "The value of the variable is `${VARIABLE}"`

In bash, `$(command)` is used to execute the command inside the parenthesis and substitute the output of that command in place of the expression. It is known as command substitution. For example, echo Today is $(date) will execute the date command and substitute the output in place of $(date) so the output will be like "Today is Mon Jan 16 15:12:43 PST 2022"

To use or set an environment variable in a script, you should prefix the variable with export keyword. `export MY_ENV_VAR="Hello World"`. Now in the shell, this variable will be available. Environment variables are only available for the current session

You can use a here-doc to include the contents of another file in a bash script. You can use cat command and the here-doc notation to include the contents of a file in your script, like this:

```
cat << EOF
$(cat /path/to/file)
EOF
```

Gets the first match of a file glob:

```
Echo $(ls -1 .txt)
```
