LaTex 

The following are LaTeX file extensions and their meaning:

-   .aux: LaTeX auxiliary file that contains information about cross-references and citations in a document.
-   .bbl: LaTeX file that contains bibliographic information generated by BibTeX.
-   .bcf: Binary version of the .bbl file, used by the BibTeX utility.
-   .blg: Log file generated by BibTeX, containing information about the references used in the document.
-   .lof: List of Figures, generated by LaTeX.
-   .log: Log file generated by LaTeX, containing information about the compiling process.
-   .xml: Extensible Markup Language, a markup language used for representing structured data.
-   .gz: A file compressed using the gzip format.
-   .tex: LaTeX source file.
-   .toc: Table of Contents, generated by LaTeX.

Not all of these extensions are necessary inputs for LaTeX. The most important are the .tex source file, and the auxiliary files (.aux, .bbl, .bcf) that are required if the document contains citations and a bibliography. The other files are optional and used for different purposes such as creating a table of contents, a list of figures, or to display log information about the compiling process.
