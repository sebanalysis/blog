You have 'network area connections' LAN, MAN, WAN and network layers. (called the OSI model).

These are completely distinct things.

#### Network Area Connections

In networking, different types of area connections refer to the geographical scope or coverage of a network. The three main types of area connections are:

1. Local Area Network (LAN): A LAN is a network that covers a limited geographic area, typically within a single building or a small group of nearby buildings. LANs are commonly used in homes, offices, schools, and small businesses. Ethernet is a commonly used technology for LANs. Uses Ethernet and WiFi
    
2. Metropolitan Area Network (MAN): A MAN is a network that spans a larger geographic area than a LAN, typically covering a city or a metropolitan area. MANs are designed to interconnect multiple LANs and provide connectivity across a broader region. Fiber optic networks, broadband technologies, and wireless connections can be used for MANs. - Doesn't use Ethernet or WiFi.
    
3. Wide Area Network (WAN): A WAN is a network that covers a wide geographical area, such as a country, continent, or even globally. WANs are used to connect geographically dispersed LANs or MANs. The internet itself is an example of a global WAN. WAN connections can include leased lines, dedicated connections, virtual private networks (VPNs), and public networks. - Doesn't use Ethernet or WiFi.

### Network Layers


All of these layers are nested inside each other like Russian dolls.  Key point is that TCP/IP travels over Ethernet or WiFI in the LAN.

Local-hosting a website at the address: `127.0.0.1:4000` does involve the network layers.
Local-hosting a database via `http://localhost/`  does not use Network protocols at all. It typically uses the Unix domain socket protocol for communication rather than a network protocol.
If you have a DB over LAN, it each machine will connect via the "TCP/IP" hostname. 

#### Layers 1 - 3

HTML, REST API, CRUD database operations. ETL,, encryption, compression, sessions. Not really what we mean by networking.

#### TCP = Layer 4 and IP = Layer 5

TCP = The transport layer (4) provides reliable and transparent end-to-end data transfer between hosts. It manages issues such as data segmentation, reassembly, flow control, and error recovery. Protocols such as TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) operate at this layer. This layer uses TCP encryption (previously SSL) behind all the https requests running on it. . SSL encryption is still used for direct server-client connections with databases. SSL had vuneratbilities. Before, http traffic was unencryped.

IP = The network layer (5) handles packet routing and forwarding. It determines the optimal path for data packets to travel across interconnected networks. IP (Internet Protocol) is a prominent network layer protocol.

TCP IP are used together hence the grouping.

#### Ethernet or WiFi - Layer 6

Here's a breakdown of commonly used data link protocols for each type of area connection:

Local Area Network (LAN):

- Ethernet: Ethernet is the most widely used data link protocol for LANs. It defines the physical and data link layers and provides a common standard for wired and wireless LAN communication.
- Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11): Wi-Fi is a wireless data link protocol commonly used for LANs. It allows devices to connect to a network wirelessly and supports communication within a limited range.

Metropolitan Area Network (MAN):

- Ethernet: Ethernet can also be used in MANs, especially for connecting multiple LANs within a metropolitan area.
- Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM): ATM is a data link protocol that can be used in MANs for high-speed, connection-oriented communication.

Wide Area Network (WAN):

- Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP): PPP is commonly used in WANs to establish point-to-point connections over various network types, such as serial connections, dial-up connections, or VPNs.
- Frame Relay: Frame Relay is a packet-switched data link protocol used in WANs. It provides efficient and cost-effective communication between multiple sites.
- Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS): MPLS is a data link protocol used in WANs for efficient packet forwarding and traffic management in service provider networks.
- SONET/SDH (Synchronous Optical Networking/Synchronous Digital Hierarchy): SONET/SDH is a fiber-optic data link protocol used for high-speed WAN connections.

#### Physical world layer 7

Not our problem.
