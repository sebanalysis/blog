I use a Kindle 4 (released in 2011) because it has no touch screen and more like a normal book and only around $40. I use Calibre to get EPUB files on to it. Calibre does the conversion to the Kindle MOBI format. If I have to buy an EPUB from a store such as: 

> [The Living Bible eBook by Tyndale - EPUB Book | Rakuten Kobo United Kingdom](https://www.kobo.com/gb/en/ebook/the-living-bible)

When you try to download the book, you will instead get a small XML file called: 'URLLinkacsm'. 

To get the file first Download Adobe Digital Editions software:

> [ADOBE DIGITAL EDITIONS Download](https://www.adobe.com/solutions/ebook/digital-editions/download.html)

Load this plugin into Calibre:

Done!
