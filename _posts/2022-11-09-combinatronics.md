# Combinatronics
## The Four Relevant Factors

Four things you need to identify for any combinatorics question:
1. __Combination__ or __Permuation__: Are we counting 'resulting selection' with same items but differently ordered just once (combination) or for each different order (permuations)?
2. __With__ or __Without__ Repetition: Are we selecting from types of objects or individual object instances? I.e. Can we have the same item type appear more than once in a resulting selection?
4. Resulting Selection Size (__𝒓__): the number of instances of item in the resulting selection (a.k.a. the sample size)
3. Number of Object Types (__𝒏__): number of types of the item we are selecting from (a.k.a. the number of objects).


### Combination vs Permutation:  
Each combination of 𝒓 items has many ways of arranging the order, known as permutations. Assuming no repetition of object types, there are 𝒓! permutations for each combination. If there is repetition, there is a much more complicated equation for the ratio.
- In a 'combination' the order is irrelevant and we count each time the same item types appears in the resulting selection but ignore combinations with a different order. Each combination has a number of possible permutations, which we ignore. E.g. in a slot machine where 🍇🍍🍊 == 🍍🍇🍊 == 🍍🍊🍇 etc.  Collectively, the 6 possible 'permutations' only represent 1 combination, and we only count the combinations. Another example of a combination is selecting people for a committee. 
- In a 'permutation', the order is relevant and we count every order of object types that appears in the resulting selection. E.g. Numbers in a combination lock, or a committee with assigned roles.



### With or Without Repetition
- With Repetitions: Allow and count the repeating object types in the resulting selection. This is when there is a pool of object types rather than actual object instances. E.g. numbers, categories of objects.
- Without repetitions: Don't count or allow repeating objects types in the resulting selection.  This is when there is a pool of individual instances of objects which can only be selected once E.g. physical objects or people.

### Resulting Selection Size (𝒓)
- 𝒓: A Sample a.k.a. 'Resulting selection' ,  contains '𝒓' item instances.

### Number of Object Types (𝒏)
- 𝒏: The pool of objects contains '𝒏' object types.

## The Equations
All combinations (with or without repetition) and permutations (without repetition) are found using some version of the [binomial coefficient equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_coefficient):. This equation, often vocalised as '𝒏 choose 𝒓' or '𝒏 choose 𝒌' is expressed as either: $nCr$ or, $\binom{n}{r}$.
$$\binom{n}{r} = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!} $$

-| Combination<br>(𝒓 is Unordered) | Permutation<br>(𝒓 is Ordered)
 -|-|-
Without Repetition<br>(Instances of 𝒏)| [Combination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination#Number_of_k-combinations) $$\binom{n}{r}$$| [Permuation without repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation#Permutations_without_repetitions) $$ r!\binom{n}{r} $$
With Repetition<br>(Types of 𝒏)| [Multiset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiset#Counting_multisets)  $$\binom{n+r-1}{r}$$ | [Permuation with repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation#Permutations_with_repetition)$$ n^r $$

Scientific calculators often have the binomial coefficient function normally written as '$nCr$' or '$\binom{n}{r}$' as above.  The Windows 10 calculator doesn't have this function, so the easiest way for quick calculation is to find an online calculator such as [this](https://www.omnicalculator.com/math/binomial-coefficient).

### Examples

Lets take the examples of a slot machine, committee, role assignment and a combination lock. Each example has a result selection (𝒓) of 3 and 10 object types or instances (𝒏).
