**Secure Shell** is a command line login service typically used for command line programs communicating with remote servers such as. A common use case is git communicating with GitHub. It is an alternative to using HTTPS. Rather than saving a basic password to windows credential manager, you instead save a private-key and public-key text file to the `~\.ssh` directory(i.e. the `C:\Users\<username>\.ssh` directory).

The public key; you copy-paste onto the server website via the browser. The private-key, is used by the ssh-agent program, almost always OpenSSH, to gain access to the server. This system is more secure than HTTPS as it does not require user input to enter a password and the pre-generated password is mathematically un-crackable.

But unlike HTTPS, an SSH key pair is only used for authentication during the initial handshake, not to encrypt and decrypt incoming and outgoing data. OpenSSH is integrated into Windows, Mac and Linux.

Everyone is familiar with HTTP URLs such as:

- `https://github.com/user/repo.git`
- in the format: `<protocol>://<nth-level-domain>â€¦.<2nd-level-domain>.<top-level-domain>/<file_path or query or fragment>`,

But, SSH URLs are simpler and less flexible. They only find a use in the command line. They can also only include a file-path, not queries and fragments, like in HTTP URLs. This is the sort of SSH URL you will need to add to a git repository:

- `git@github.com:user/repo.git`
- in the format `<User>@<Host>/<file_path>`

Unfortunately, knowledge of SSH is assumed and it is generally poorly explained.

## Getting SSH on Windows

OpenSSH is an ['optional feature'](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18683092/how-to-run-ssh-add-on-windows) in Windows 10.  Check there is a path assigned in Powershell with the command: `(gcm ssh).path`. It should be in: `C:\WINDOWS\System32\OpenSSH`.

Under this folder, in addition to `ssh.exe`, there should also be :

- `scp.exe` - remote copy over port 22 - faster but cannot pause and resume.
- `sftp.exe` - remote copy, view, create, and delete over port 22 -equal security
- `ssh-add.exe` and `ssh-agent.exe` - holds keys ready for use.
- `ssh-keygen.exe`- generates the private and public keys used in SSH.
- `ssh-keyscan.exe` - scans a list of hosts from the config file and collects the public keys.

If you don't have these OpenSSH programs aleady, search `Manage optional features` from the start menu and make sure you have `Open SSH Client` in the list. If not, you should be able to add it.

## Automatic ssh-agent activation

Git windows installation also installs `start-ssh-agent.cmd` and `start-ssh-pageant.cmd` following to `C:\Program Files\Git\cmd`. Git should use these to start the `ssh-agent` each time a git remote command is called.

 But if SSH is not working with git, search `Services` from the start Menu Scroll down to `OpenSSH Authentication Agent` > right click > properties.  Change the Startup type from Disabled to any of the other 3 options. I have mine set to `Automatic (Delayed Start)`.

## Using SSH with GitHub

Unlike logging in with HTTPS, which is self explanatory, for SSH to work with a GitHub account, you need:

- SSH private key files saved in `~\.ssh` and registered with `ssh-add`.
- SSH public keys (`â€¦.pub` extension) text registered on your GitHub account.
- SSH `Host`, `Hostname`, `User` and `IdentityFile` parameters added to your `~\.ssh\conf` file
- SSH address added as the remote location to your local GitHub repo in the format: `User@Host:GitHubUserName/repo`
- Your `user.name` and `user.email` configured in git.

And there are lots or errors which can mess things up.

[Delete all existing GitHub HTTPS credentials in windows credential manager](https://betterprogramming.pub/how-to-use-multiple-github-accounts-with-one-computer-c9ba3f851b75):
- Type `credential` into start (`Control Panel\All Control Panel Items\Credential Manager`),
- Find `git:http://github.com`. These are the HTTPS keys. Delete them.


Delete existing SSH keys  from the OpenSSH register:
```
ssh-add -d
```

Make a new key with OpenSSH called for example `name_key` and saved in the `~\.ssh` directory. On the next line you should name the key for future reference, using. You have to enter full file path using `/` file separators:  e.g.: `.ssh/name_key`.. You will reference this file later in the `~\.ssh\config` file.

```
ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "youremail@whatever.com"
```

Add the private key (the one without the .pub file extension) to OpenSSH:

```
ssh-add .ssh/name_key
```

Check the key is registered in OpenSSH:

```
ssh-add -l
```

Add the text in the `.ssh/name_key.pub` file to your GitHub account.

Create, or open a text file called `config` in the `.ssh` directory and enter the details for the given account.

- `Host`: your custom handle for the service. If you have only 1 account, you can make it the same as `HostName`
- `HostName`: The IP address or HTTP URL of the server in question.
- `IdentityFile`: The path to the private key which you just generated.
- `IdentitiesOnly`: When you have uniquely named `Host` for each account on the same service, you can add the `IdentitiesOnly yes` command which tells the ssh-agent will only try sending the private key corresponding to that particular Host.

I recommend naming the `Host` yourself. This custom `Host` name is what you will need to write into the git remote repo URL. It is possible to leave the default, but it can become confusing if you have multiple accounts with the `Host` called github.com. I prefer to name the host explicitly. That way you can also test access to each host individually with `ssh -T git@<Host>`, and you can drill down to the culprit. For example:

```
Host name_it
  User git
  HostName github.com
  IdentityFile C:\Users\Seb\.ssh\name_key
  IdentitiesOnly yes
```

Check your access is successful ðŸ¤ž:

```
ssh -T git@name_it
```

Because you have changed the host from the default `github.com` to `name_it`, you will have to modify the default SSH address for the repo on the website.

Clone with the repo using the format `<User>@<Host>:<GitHubUserName>/<repo>`:

```
git clone git@name_it/someuser/somerepo.git
```

Or change the address of an existing repo from HTTPS to SSH by first removing the existing URL, and then adding the new SSH URL:

```
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin git@name_it/someuser/somerepo.git
```

Check you have successfully added the new SSH URL:

```
git remote -v
```

If you have multiple accounts, you have to add the the git username and git email which you want to use for that repo. These are the names which appear on the git commits, both local and on GitHub. It is unrelated to SSH, but can be confusing and make you think that you're connected to that repo via the wrong SSH details. Navigate to the repo and run:

```
git config user.name yourname
git config user.email youremail@whatever.com
```

The values will then be stored in in the `.git/config` for that repo rather than your global configuration file.

You are finally done!

Common issues:

1. Check the correct SSH URL is attached to the repo. Importantly, that it is not an HTTPS URL.
2. The previously saved HTTPS keys are being used when they shouldn't. [Delete all existing credentials in windows credential manager](https://betterprogramming.pub/how-to-use-multiple-github-accounts-with-one-computer-c9ba3f851b75)
3. [Check SSH program is active](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/464574/ssh-add-returns-with-error-connecting-to-agent-no-such-file-or-directory).
