## Install Conda

Install only Miniconda as Anaconda is bloated and doesn't make sense anyway without understanding Miniconda. 

Find `Anaconda Powershell Prompt (Miniconda3)` in start and run `conda init`, it writes the startup script to this profile:
-   Current User, All Hosts  `$PROFILE.CurrentUserAllHosts`.  
	- `$Home\Documents\PowerShell\Profile.ps1`

It leaves your Host profile unchanged.
-   Current user, Current Host `$profile` . As this is the shortest one, I prefer to store all my settings here so that I can run `. $profile`  to refresh after I change the env.  `$Home\Documents\PowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1`

`conda config --set changeps1 False` disables showing the activated env in PowerShell by changing the `activate.ps1` config script.

For me this is found at:
`C:\ProgramData\Miniconda3\pkgs\python-3.9.12-h6244533_0\Lib\venv\scripts\common`


To install on linux powershell I had to also add it to the path:

```powershell
$env:PATH="$HOME/miniconda3/bin:$env:PATH"
```

## Create environment

Python 11 is much faster. Conda env create. 

`conda create --name <env_name> python=3.11`

But if you are creating from a yml file you need to use
`conda env create --file requirements.yml`

To install into a prexisting environment:
```
conda env update --file environment.yml
```



To install a pip a setup.py file you have to use the above command to first create the environment.

## Mixing pip and conda


If you use `pip install .`, conda will use pip to install the package and will not track the package via conda, so it won't be visible in the conda list of packages, and it may lead to dependency conflict, so you should use this method with caution.

If you mix using pip and conda in a given environment, you have a risk of breaking the environment.

i.e. The following warning message may occur
```
WARNING conda.gateways.disk.delete:unlink_or_rename_to_trash(143): Could not remove or rename
```
Clear out your packages

```python
conda clean --all
```

## Channels

Search for all packages in a channel:
```bash
conda search --override-channels -c channel '*'
```


## Install Requirements if Requirements.txt file

conda install mamba
mamba install -r requirements.txt

## Understand the commands

Always activate the relevant environment for your repo before installing as it is non trivial to bulk uninstall all the custom packages in the base environment.

#### Some key commands:

`conda …` means packages

`conda env …` means environment. Except if you are creating one. then its just `conda create -n ...`

## .condarc file
[Guidance](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/configuration/use-condarc.html)

The .condarc file is found in the home directory and it contains the configuration settings for conda.

#### Add to the condarc file:

```
always_yes: True
channel_priority: true
Channels:
- conda-forge
```
### Install Mamba

Mamba is just a much quicker way of installing packages. Install Mamba with:

```
conda update -y --all
```

```
conda install -c conda-forge mamba
```

Then you can just use the mamba command word instead of conda  in all circumstances. For example the two commands are equivalent but mamba is faster:

```
conda install black
mamba install black
```

Mamba uses the condarc config file too.

### Set the env directory

All envs will be installed to the path set n the condarc:

In Linux should be:
```yml
envs_dirs: 
  - /home/sebastian/miniconda3/envs
```

In windows should be:
```yaml
envs_dirs:
  - C:\ProgramData\Miniconda3\envs
```


## The environment.yaml file

When you want to export an environment with conda you can run the following command to generate an environment file:
```
conda env export > environment.yml
```

You can only import a _new_ environment from an environment file, not a requirements.txt file. 

```
mamba env create --file .\env.yml --name <name>
mamba activate <name>
```

If you don't have an env.yml file, you have to create an empty environment and then install after:

```
mamba env create --name <name>
mamba activate <name>
```

Note that update will __not__ install any new packages from an environment file. It will only update.

```
mamba env update --file .\env.yml --name <name> 
```

Remove an environment if you mess it up. It is not possible to reset an environment:

```
conda env remove --name rapyds
```





## Spyder Troubleshooting
1.  uninstall pyQt using

`conda uninstall pyqt`

2.  uninstall sip package

`conda uninstall sip`

3.  then install these packages in following order

`conda install sip`

`conda install pyqt`

`conda upgrade spyder`

this worked for me.

## Environment variables

In a python environment you have many of the same environment variables as in the shell. 
- PowerShell environment variables are given by `ls env:` and accessed with `$env:name`. I copied them into a list called winpath.
- Python environment variables are given by `pprint.pprint(dict(os.environ).keys())`  and accessed with `os.environ['name']`

`os.environ` is case sensitive on linux but not on windows. Nevertheless, certain enviroment variable strings are stored in Uppercase in windows and lowercase in python:


The __PowerShell environment variables__ are not in python:

```python
>>> [p for p in map(lambda x: x.lower(), winpath) if p not in map(lambda x: x.lower(), dict(os.environ).keys())]

['conda_prompt_modifier', 'powershell_distribution_chann…']
```

The __python environment variables__ are not in PowerShell 

```python
>>> [p for p in map(lambda x: x.lower(), ) if p not in map(lambda x: x.lower(), dict(os.environ).keys())]
['CONDA_DEFAULT_ENV',
 'CONDA_PREFIX',
 'CONDA_PYTHON_EXE',
 'CONDA_SHLVL',
 'POWERSHELL_DISTRIBUTION_CHANNEL']
```
``

# Errors

## Random loss of ability to use conda

I turned off Documents onedrive sync, which changed the registry path for my user shell folder for my documents from one drive (where my powerershell currentuserallhosts profile is stored) .

That is where the conda init script for powershell goes to:  `$Home\Documents\PowerShell\Profile.ps1`. Just had to run conda init again.

## Unnamed Environments

## A newer version of conda exists

```
==> WARNING: A newer version of conda exists. <==
  current version: 4.10.3
  latest version: 22.11.1
```

You have to update using the __conda-forge__ channel, not the defaults channel.

```
conda update -n base -c conda-forge conda
```

## ERROR conda.core.link:_execute(740): An error occurred while installing package 'conda-forge::

You cache is likely corrupted

```
conda clean --all
```

## A package which appears in conda list cannot be imported

Don't use `py` for python as doesn't point towards your conda executable it points towards:

```
C:\Windows\py.exe
```

Check that the capitalisation and spelling of every package is identical to that on the repo. Pint seems to have changed from `pint` to `Pint` after version 0.2, and I spend literally hours reinstalling and debugging my entire system trying to figure out why I couldn't import the module. Also, specifying `>=0.9` was not as affective as saying `=0.9.*`

Just don't name modules with capital letters.

Mixing mamba and conda could cause problems.
