Where to start off. I have tried various cold installs of python. The best way is to install [Miniconda3](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) by navigating to the website. The winget version is out of date. There is also Miniforge3 which is just Miniconda but with the conda-forge channel added by default (some licensing issue work around as Ananconda, the developers of conda are a private company) but Winget installs it to your user directory for some reason even though site-packages is in the ProgramData folder which makes things confusing. MambaForge is in principle better and faster, but it does not show the enviroment in my oh-my-posh line, and it also would not actually update the `CONDA_PREFIX` environment vareable and thus work.



## Managing Which version of python you use

The venv tool is now built into python, and it is a much more lightweight and simple way to manage small projects that conda. But python on its own does not allow you to select a version of itself, or to install a venv from a particular python version. You have to choose that in advance. 

You can either install a version of python directly, as required, with your OS package manager, like apt-get on ubuntu or winget on windows. 

- On linux, the executables are named by their version so you can always select which version you want easily.  IApart from the default version of python on your system which is just called python. In Ubuntu and other Debian-based systems, the default version of Python is usually the version that is considered to be the most stable and widely-used. In the case of Ubuntu 20.08, this is version 3.8. The package maintainers have chosen to name the package 'python' to indicate that this is the default version of Python that is intended to be used by most users.
- On windows all the python versions are just called `python` and the only way to manage which one you use is by moving things up and down the system path. Or you can launch the desired Python executable directly: `C:/path/to/specific/python.exe -m venv` or you can use the 'Python Launcher' program which is installed by default on windows 10 and allows you to use the `py` command to point to a version of python like this `py -2.5 -m venv`. 

If you run python -m venv, it will create a virtual environment with the version of python pointed to by `python`.  That is the first python executable `.COM;.EXE;.BAT;.CMD;.VBS;.VBE;.JS;.JSE;.WSF;.WSH;.MSC;.PY;.PYW;.RB;.RBW` that appears in the system path. Even if you are in a virtual environment, it will just mean that the `python` is currently a certain version and it will make the virtual env in that version.


Numpy and thus pandas does not appear to be compatible with 3.12 yet as of 2023.

## Linux

Without any middle man programs using the OS default method.

But on linux, you are able to use `python3.11` for example.  n Linux, when you install a version of python through whatever package manager you use, the executable is always suffixed with the version of Python. Which allows you to always select the version of Python, which you want to use for the succeeding commands. 
Use Python.

Latest Python 3.10, 3.11 or 3.12 is not available in Ubuntu’s default repositories. So, we have to add an additional repository. On launchpad repository named [deadsnakes](https://launchpad.net/~deadsnakes/+archive/ubuntu/ppa) is available for Python Packages.

Add the **deadsnakes** repository using the below commands.

```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
```

Running the command `sudo apt-get update` updates the `apt-cache` on your Linux system.

```
sudo apt-get update
```

Verify the updated Python packages list using this command.

```
apt-cache search python3.10
```


install Python 3.10 by using the below command :

```
sudo apt-get install python3.10
```

Linux puts all these executables in the `usr/bin/` directory, so now you can run:
```
which python3.10
```
and you should see the path to your python installation. 

Now it you make a venv. 

## Windows in general

Without any middle man programs using the OS default method.

On Windows, you can execute the pip module using a given Python version through the [Python launcher](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3111/), from the python.com website, `py.exe`, if you chose to install it during Python 3 setup..$

```
py -3 -m venv
py -2.5 -m venv
```

You must create an enviroment variable: PYLAUNCHER_ALLOW_INSTALL to any value to enable it to install versions on demand.

The most recent version appears to be the version when you don't add the --version qualifier. I.e. 3.11.1.

## Conda 

Everyone knows how to use conda. You install Miniconda and it just works.

You have to open _either_ Anaconda prompt Powershell or CMD in admin mode and write conda init. This creates `C:\Users\name\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\profile.ps1` and 
`C:\Users\name\Documents\PowerShell\profile.ps1` if they don't already exist and writes the following string to them:

```powershell
#region conda initialize
# !! Contents within this block are managed by 'conda init' !!
If (Test-Path "C:\ProgramData\miniconda3\Scripts\conda.exe") {
    (& "C:\ProgramData\miniconda3\Scripts\conda.exe" "shell.powershell" "hook") | Out-String | ?{$_} | Invoke-Expression
}
#endregion
```

It also adds an autorun to CMD in registry. Annoying if you use powershell and you can delete it.

## Poetry.

First install poetry with either pip (from PyPi) or 


## Pip cannot install versions of python

There is no way to change python versions with pip. The following just installs the package which is compatible with a particular version of python. But when you run `python`, it will call whatever is in your system path.

Since version 0.8, Pip supports `pip-{version}` i.e. `pip2.5 install package`. 


    By default, pip installs packages to the site-packages directory of the Python installation that it is associated with. 


## Scripts Folder

Some Python packages, particularly those that include command-line interfaces (CLIs), include executable files that can be run from the command line. These executables are typically installed in the "Scripts" folder of the Python installation, so that they can be easily accessed from the command prompt. This allows users to run the package's CLI commands without having to navigate to the specific location of the package's source code.
