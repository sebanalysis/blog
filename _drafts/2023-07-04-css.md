In CSS, the ID selector has higher specificity than the class selector, so it takes precedence.

The specificity hierarchy in CSS is as follows, from highest to lowest:

1. Inline styles (an element's style attribute) `<div style="margin: 0; width:100vw"`
2. ID selectors `#name {margin: 0; width:100vw}`
3. Class selectors, attribute selectors, and pseudo-classes `.name {margin:0; width}`
4. Element type selectors and pseudo-elements `div {margin:0; width:100vw}

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) can be used to style virtually all elements of a HTML document. This includes the following categories:

1. **Block-level elements**: These are elements that take up the full width available (i.e., they create a new line before and after the element). Examples include `<div>`, `<h1>` through `<h6>`, `<p>`, `<form>`, and `<ul>`.
    
2. **Inline elements**: These are elements that do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary. Examples include `<span>`, `<a>`, `<img>`, `<button>`, and `<input>`.
    
3. **Embedded elements**: These are elements that are used to add media into your document, like images, videos, audio. Examples include `<img>`, `<video>`, `<audio>`, `<canvas>`, and `<svg>`.
    
4. **Table elements**: These elements are used to create tables. Examples include `<table>`, `<tr>`, `<td>`, `<th>`, and `<caption>`.
    
5. **List elements**: These are elements that create different types of lists. Examples include `<ul>`, `<ol>`, and `<li>`.
    
6. **Form elements**: These elements are used to collect user input. Examples include `<form>`, `<input>`, `<textarea>`, `<button>`, `<select>`, and `<option>`.
    
7. **Semantic elements**: These are elements that provide meaning about the type of content they contain, helping search engines and assistive technologies better understand the content. Examples include `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, and `<footer>`.
